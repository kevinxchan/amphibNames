        p
            | Taxonomies of amphibians are constantly being updated as new research introduces new findings, and
            | updates to the tree of life. Therefore, amphibNames is a tool to allow batch updating of amphibian
            | taxonomy strings in the form of genus-species. It takes in a .txt file delimited by newlines or commas,
            | looks each entry up in (currently) two databases, and retrieves the most recent taxonomy assigned to
            | that organism. The databases amphibNames uses are the
            | #[a(href="http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/", class="hvr-float") Amphibian Species of the World],
            | and #[a(href="https://amphibiaweb.org/", class="hvr-float") AmphibiaWeb].
        p To get started, upload a .txt file containing a list of genus-species names delimited by commas or newlines below.
